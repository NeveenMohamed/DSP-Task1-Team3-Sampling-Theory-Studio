# Sampling-Theory Studio
## Introduction 
### sampling an analog signal is a crucial step for any digital signal processing system The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem guarantees a full recovery of the signal when sampling with a frequency larger than or equal to the bandwidth of the signal (or double the maximum frequency in case of real signals).
## Description 
### It is a web application that illustrates the signal sampling and recovery showing the importance and validation of the nyquist rate

* Our application have the following features:
   * Visualize and sample an uploaded signal and use the sampled points to recover the original signal
   * Adding noise to the loaded signal and reconstructing it. 
   * Prepare mixed signal by adding sinusoidal signals with different frequancy and magnitudes. 
   * Sampling and reconstructing the mixed signal.
   * Adding noise to the mixed signal and reconstructing it.
   * Remove any component from the mixed signal.
   * Downloading the reconstructed signal.
   * Resize the signals without missing the UI.
